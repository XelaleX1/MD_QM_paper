This repository contains electronic supporting information for the paper "Simulation of polymeric mixed ionic and electronic conductors with a combined classical and quantum mechanical model",
submitted to J. Mater. Chem. C, doi:?? by A. Landi, M. Reisjalali, J. Elliot, M. Matta, P. Carbone and A. Troisi.

We here provide the LAMMPS input, the torsional potential for the dihedral highlighted in Fig. 2 of the paper and starting topologies for the systems with 25% and 75% charged chains
